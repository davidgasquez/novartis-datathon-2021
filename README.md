# Novartis Datathon 2021

Code and resources for Novartis 2021 Datathon.

# Quickstart

Open Vistual Studio Code and install the `Remote - Container` extension. A popup will ask you if you want to run the project in a containerized environment. Click `Yes` and after the container has finished building, you should be in!

Alternatively, you can run `make notebook` and head over to `http://localhost:8888` to open Jupyter Lab.
